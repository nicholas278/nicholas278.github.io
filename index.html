				<p class="content">Hi, my name is Nicholas, but you can call me Nick.  I am currently working as a Realtor.  I am also doing a few tech projects on the side.  Although both of these things do not sound relevant, there is actually something in common: they both involve the web.</p> 
				<p class="content">In the past 2 years, I have been self learning various web related platforms, such as <strong>HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL, C#</strong>.  With a bit of programming background, I was able to pick them up relatively fast.  Although I have a rough idea of how to create a full fledge web application, I am still not too confident that I am doing it right.  So I decided to take this program to ensure that my foundation is solid, and also to learn more advance techniques that I have yet to explore. </p>

				<h3 class="heading">SKILLS</h3>
				<p class="content">Other than the languages I listed in the about section, I have also learned to use a few frameworks, such as <strong>JQuery, NodeJS, and Codeignitor</strong>.  I am able to use these to create basic web applications, but I have yet to be able to harness the full potential of these frameworks.</p>
				<p class="content">Here is one of the web applications I was working on: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vancouverbchousing.com/sportapp">Sportapp</a>. It is still in the prototyping phase, so it may be a little buggy.</p>

				<h3 class="heading">LINKS</h3>
				<h4 class="heading"><a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a></h4>
				<p class="content">This is the site I probably used the most while programming.  It contains a lot of information on pretty much every language I know how to use.  If I run into a problem, most likely someone has already asked the same question.</p>
				<h4 class="heading"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a></h4>
				<p class="content">Whoever has written any HTML will probably know this website.  It contains all the documentations for pretty much all web related language.</p>
				<h4 class="heading"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a></h4>
				<p class="content">This website has one of the best learning platform for web programming.  It creates a game-like learning environment, which really helps motivate and excite anyone going through it.</p>
